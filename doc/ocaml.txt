*ocaml.txt*        Filetype plugin for OCaml

CONFIGURATION                                    *ocaml-configuration*

                                                 *g:ocaml_highlight_operators*

By default operators are not linked to the Operator group and thus not
highlighted. You can turn on highlighting of operators by defining:

  let g:ocaml_highlight_operators = 1

                                                         *g:odoc_html_support*

By default HTML code inlined in OCamldoc/Odoc syntax is not highlighted to
avoid loading the HTML syntax. You can turn on HTML highlighting by defining:

  let g:odoc_html_support = 1

                                           *g:ocaml_compiler_compact_messages*

By default the output of the OCaml compiler is filtered to keep only the
location and message by the compiler plugin. You can keep the full multi-line
messages as displayed by the compiler by defining:

  let g:ocaml_compiler_compact_messages = 0
