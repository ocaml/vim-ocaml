                                                 *g:ocaml_highlight_operators*

By default operators are not linked to the Operator group and thus not
highlighted. You can turn on highlighting of operators by defining:

  let g:ocaml_highlight_operators = 1

                                                 *g:ocaml_use_v2_syntax*

Use new syntax declarations, which correctly highlight types. Currently this
syntax has a few bugs in the presence of module and functor types, and is
therefore disabled by default.
