# vim-ocaml

Vim runtime files for OCaml. These are synced periodically with the builtin
support that comes with Vim. Users are recommended to use this repository
directly however as it's more up to date.

## Installation

Depending on your plugin manager:

```vim
Plugin 'ocaml/vim-ocaml'
```

```vim
NeoBundleInstall ocaml/vim-ocaml'

" or use NeoBundleLazy
NeoBundleLazy 'ocaml/vim-ocaml', {'autoload' : {'filetypes' : [
    \ 'ocaml', 'ocamlinterface', 'ocamllex', 'menhir', 'dune', 'opam',
    \ 'oasis', 'omake', 'ocamlbuild_tags', 'sexplib']}}
```

## History

This repo started out by @rgrinberg extracting Markus Mottl's improvements to
the builtin OCaml support in Vim. Later, support for more OCaml related tools
was added: dune, opam etc. Nowadays, it's maintained by a team.
